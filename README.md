# The Project
I will be creating a text adventure RPG using Python for my final project, mainly utilizing a series of if and else statements in order to create a story with branching paths and endings.
Every week, the goal will be to create a new set of scenarios that the player will navigate, facing me with a separate set of challenges related to choice driven storytelling and clean program organization

## Features
I want to attempt a visual element within the RPG, such as a map or maybe character assets, so I will probably need to implement cowsay or employ a different method of text based image generation.
Additionally, the goal ids for this to be fun and light, not a boring slog, so I will make the choices interesting and impactful, along with a set of interactive puzzles to give players a challenge

## Outcomes
Ideal: A game with many interesting choices linked to a variety of fun and whimsical text based images that appear as a reward of sorts for making a certain choice. 
Minimal Viable: A game with a number of branching paths leading to different named endings which have minimal imagery presented by cowsay.

## Weekly Milestones
Week 1: Create a barebones structure for choices and a functional gameplay loop
Week 2: Implement variety of story beats and choices that link and split off from the beginning
Week 3: Polish story telling and endings, implementing visuals where there is time and where I feel they are appropriate
